First in your class in school? High school?
Yes, sir.
How many in the class?
Uh, 12. It was a small town.
I'll say.
But I was also first in my radar class in the Navy, and that was a class of 20.
Can I say something? I'm the type of person...if you ask me a question, and I don't know the answer,
I'm gonna tell you that I don't know. But I bet you what. I know how to find the answer. And I will find
the answer. Is that fair enough?
Chris. What would you say if a guy walked in for an interview without a shirt on, and I hired him? 
What would you say?
He must've had on some really nice pants. 

Hey Forrest, were you scared in Vietnam?
Yes. Well, I don't know. Sometimes it would start raining long enough for the stars to come out. 
And then it was nice. It was like just before the sun goes to bed down on the bayou. There was always a
million sparkles on the water. Like that mountain lake. It was so clear, Jenny, it looked like there were two
skies, one on top of the other. And then in the desert, when the sun comes up, I couldn't tell where heaven 
stopped and where the earth began. It was so beautiful.
I wish I could've been there with you.
You were.
I love you.
